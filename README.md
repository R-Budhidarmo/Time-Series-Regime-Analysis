# Time-Series-Regime-Analysis

An exploratory study on econometrics, time series analysis, regime analysis, and model evaluation using ```statsmodels``` Python library.

*Note:* This was an assignment which I submitted for an econometrics course (It was supposed to be a group project, but I ended up doing 99.9% of the work. C'est la vie ...)
